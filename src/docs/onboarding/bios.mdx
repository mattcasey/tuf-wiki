After about 1 month of service, we love to commemorate new team members involvement with TUF by adding you to Our Team page on our website and with an Instagram post!

**A TUF operational member will reach out to you for your bio.**

## Need from you:

- [x] Your super official title that represents your role in the foundation.
  - Feel free to give us a fun title too (eg. “Events Queen”)
- [x] A short bio (max ~100 words) that describes your background and interests
  - See examples on the [Our Team](https://theunderdogfoundation.org/our-team) page of our website.
- [x] 4-10 photos that represent you
  - Please include one headshot for your TUF account and website bio (let us know if you prefer this to not be included on the IG post, though— it’s up to you)
  - Check out examples on our Instagram: [@TheUnderdogFoundation](https://www.instagram.com/theunderdogfoundation/)
