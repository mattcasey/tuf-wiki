## Introduction

<img src={slack} style="width: 250px; float: left;" />

_Effective communication is the key to organizational success!_

We use Slack for informal and quick communication and collaboration among our team. If you're not familiar with Slack, it is like a group chat type app, similar to MS Teams. Outside of joining Team Meetings, it is the best way to stay connected to the org.

You are not requried or obligated to join and use Slack. We will email any important announcements or if action is required by the team. However, you may miss out on other communications and updates.

## Joining Slack

- Accept the invitation to join our workspace from your Underdog email
- Update your title and profile photo
- Download the desktop and/or mobile app:
  - [Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows)
  - [Mac](https://slack.com/help/articles/207677868-Download-Slack-for-Mac)
  - [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack&hl=en_US&gl=US)
  - [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slack/id618783545)
- Join [Channels](#channels) you're interested in
- Adjust your [notification](#notifcation) preferences

## Channels

- By default, you are added to channels relevant to everyone including: **#general**, **#announcements**, **#ideas**, and **#fun**
- Browse the channels and join others you may be interested in such as: **#tech**, **#events**, **#social-media**, **#clients-general**
- **#clients-general** is used for general communication regarding client processes, and we also have unique channels for discussions related to each client (eg. **#genna-raes**, **#hayati**)
- If you are working on a specific project with multiple people, feel free to create new channels if needed.
  - Reach out to Darian if you're not sure if a channel exists
- We use channel-based conversations when possible to promote pubilc conversations and collaboration
- Limit side conversations where possible and keep communications in channels to keep relevant team members in the loop, and to avoid creating a bunch of group DMs to sift through.

## Notifications

- Update your notification preferences to receive messages relevant to you
- You can change your overall Slack preferences to receive notifications for only @mentions and DMs
- OR you can update your notification preferences by channel
- You can mute channels entirely
- You can snooze notifications
- You can set a notification schedule
- You can have your desktop notifications be mirrored on mobile

## Best Practices

- Reply to messages in threads to keep conversations organized and limit unnecessary notifications for everyone
- Tag specific people in channels when messages are relevant to them so they receive notifcations in case they have set their preferences to only be notified for @ mention
- If you @ mention someone in a channel that they are not in, you will be prompted to add them or send them a link to the message. If you do nothing, **they will not see the message.**

## Tips

- "Save" messages by clicking the bookmark icon on a message and view them under "Saved Items" at the top of the side bar
- Use "Show All Unreads" to view all unread messages in one place
- Star Conversations you use frequently: Right-click on a channel or conversation > Star Conversation to move it to the Starred section at the top of your sidebar
- Quickly find files or pinned items in a channel by clicking "Details" in the top right to open the details sidebar
