title: Send a Takedown Request
description: Request a copycat site to be taken down

Sites like Grubhub and singleplatform.com will create business pages without the owners' permission. These pages make it harder for our websites to appear in top search results, and may also have incorrect information. Below is an example of a takedown request.

## Solutions
There's no guaranteed process, but below are some examples you can try.

### DoorDash

Submit a request through their [website](https://help.doordash.com/merchants/s/contactsupport?language=en_US).

### Postmates

Submit a request through their [website](https://support.postmates.com/merchant/contact-us/why-am-i-on-postmates).

### Grubhub

Send an email to restaurantremoval@grubhub.com including the owner’s or manager’s email, as well as the name and address of the restaurant, the sender’s name and relation to the restaurant, and the reason for requesting removal.

### Sites hosted on Amazon

You may be able to tell from [WHOIS](https://lookup.icann.org/) if a site is hosted on AWS. In that case, you can send an email to Amazon Abuse at abuse@amazonaws.com.

> Good morning,

> My name is Darian, a VP for the Underdog Foundation, a non-profit organization that sets up small businesses with websites and online ordering free of charge.

> I noticed when you Google one of our clients, Hayati Mediterranean Grill, that an AWS-hosted website, https://hayatimediterraneangrill.com/, ranks which is imitating Hayati Mediterranean. This website directs users to order online through a platform, qMenu. This platform does not take payments, but because Hayati is not managing orders that come through this platform, customers come in after have placing the order and the order has not been prepared. This is causing Hayati to make food for free effectively losing them money.

> The real website is https://hayatimediterranean.com/, which is linked to their Google Business page.
>
> This company did not have permission to imitate this business or their website and I believe it has nefarious intent. What rights does Hayati have in regards to this? Can this website be taken down?

> Please let me know if I can provide any further proof or information.
