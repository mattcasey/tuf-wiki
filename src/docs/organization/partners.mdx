## Partners

We engage in contractual agreements with small business owners when we offer our services. We try our best to use "partner" when applicable rather than "client", because _client_ implies we charge a fee.

> **We do not, and will never, charge for our services.**

That being said, it's okay to use "client" as it establishes a professional relationship with those we are providing services to.

Regardless, it is important we build a _partnership_ with our small business owners. We do not simply build websites and leave never to be seen again. We genuinely care about the success of the businesses we help, and we do everything in our power to contribute to that success.

Our goal is to help **motivated** business owners, that have already put in the work, but need a little extra boost.

## Supporters

We also have various _partnerships_ with different entities all across Denver outside of the small businesses we help. We are stronger together with the support of our network.

Below are just a few of those that have helped us along the way:

- Coyote Logistics - Corporate Donor
- Google for Non-Profit - Allows us to use G-Suite for free, and has earned us the highest amount of fundraising to date
- Artist Proof - Our local screen printing vendor
- Denver Parks & Rec
- _........ many more to be added_
