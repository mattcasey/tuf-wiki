### Introduction ðŸŽ¤

The Underdog Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that specializes in supporting small businesses in the Denver area by providing business services such as web design and photography **completely free of charge** to the business owners. All of our services are provided by in-house team members that volunteer their time, which is what makes TUF so special.

While our primary focus is on small businesses, we are not limited in the way that we can help our community. We now have an expansive volunteer network, partnerships with many small businesses and other non-profits, and relationships with the local government, and all of our connections make it possible to serve our community in various ways. Typically, if we are not able to help, we can find someone who can.

### Our Mission ðŸ’ª

> Our mission is to give _every_ community member the opportunity to succeed.

This, in most cases, means that we help small businesses in traditionally underserved communities. Nonetheless, we set out to serve disadvantaged populationsâ€” whether that is due to race, socioeconomic status, sexual identity, the pandemic, or whatever it may be.

> **unÂ·derÂ·dog** _noun._ a competitor thought to have little chance of winning a fight

We acknowledge various levels of privilege and that is why we advocate for those who are disenfranchisedâ€” _The Underdogs_.
